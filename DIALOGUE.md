# Digital Court - Video Narration Dialogue

## Opening & Introduction

Welcome to Digital Court - the future of legal decision-making powered by blockchain technology and fully homomorphic encryption.

## The Problem Statement

Traditional jury systems face critical challenges: ensuring voter privacy while maintaining transparency and preventing vote manipulation. Digital Court solves this using FHEVM technology from Zama, enabling completely private votes that remain encrypted throughout the entire process, yet still produce verifiable, transparent results.

## Core Features Demonstration - Case Creation

Creating a legal case is simple. Judges submit case details, evidence stored on IPFS, and set the required number of jurors. The smart contract handles everything on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency from the start.

## Core Features Demonstration - Private Voting

Certified jurors receive authorization to vote on specific cases. When casting a vote, it's immediately encrypted using fully homomorphic encryption. The vote remains private - even the smart contract cannot see individual choices. A cryptographic commitment hash ensures votes cannot be changed or duplicated.

## Core Features Demonstration - Results Revelation

Once voting concludes, the judge triggers result revelation. The smart contract performs homomorphic operations on encrypted votes, calculating the final tally without ever decrypting individual ballots. The verdict is determined fairly and transparently, with complete vote counts displayed publicly while maintaining individual juror anonymity.

## Technology Stack & Benefits

Digital Court is built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, integrated with Zama's FHEVM library for privacy-preserving computation. The Next.js frontend provides an intuitive interface while Ethers.js handles blockchain interactions. This combination delivers four critical guarantees: complete vote privacy through encryption, transparent process verification on the blockchain, immutable case records that cannot be altered, and democratic fairness through decentralized consensus.
